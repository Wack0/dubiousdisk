I reversed bootmgr; late one night,
Looking for issues; however slight,
Five tabs in hex-rays open, with drooping eyes,
When suddenly, to my surprise...

dubious disk
  (CVE-2022-30203, CVE-2023-21560, CVE-2023-28269, CVE-2023-28249, and more...)

Overly permissive code in Windows boot environment allows for overwriting
arbitrary memory, and therefore, arbitrary code execution.

  When reversing the Windows boot environment, I noticed that the devices that
can actually be represented, and the devices that bcdedit.exe ALLOWS to be
represented, are slightly different. Specifically, bcdedit only allows you to
specify certain types of devices, whereas the boot environment supports just
about any device structure that looks valid.

  So you can specify, for example, a vhd inside a wim, and the boot environment
will happily open and read from this device, even though bcdedit might not let
you actually represent it, if you can put it inside a BCD, the boot enviroment
will be perfectly fine with it.

  So I wrote a mod for bcdedit, unimaginatively called "bcdeditmod", that
hooks the various functions, to allow bcdedit to show and parse a new boot
device format that can handle basically anything that can be put in the device
structure.

  But what are these device structures, anyway?

  They are located in the BCD (which is a registry hive), as REG_BINARY data.

  They consist of a header, followed by a device-specific body, and the header
is a structure like so:

typedef struct _BOOT_ENVIRONMENT_DEVICE_HEADER
{
	DWORD DeviceType;
	DWORD Flags;
	DWORD Size;
	DWORD Pad;
} BOOT_ENVIRONMENT_DEVICE_HEADER, * PBOOT_ENVIRONMENT_DEVICE_HEADER;

  where DeviceType is the type of the device (body), Size is the total size of
the device structure, Pad is unused padding (set to zero), and Flags is a set
of bitflags.

  ...a set of bitflags?

  When looking at bcdedit, it sets bit 0 of these flags always, when writing a
ramdisk device, which itself is a sub-type of device type block I/O.

  Bit 0 was never set when writing out any other type of device, just this one.

  So what's so special about bit 0?

  If bit 0 is set on a device, then the boot environment won't open it. It
means the device has to be created first - the actual interesting data of the
device is zeroed out in the BCD, and initialised at runtime by the device
creation function, which also unsets bit 0 when it's done.

  OK, so what does a block IO device of type ramdisk look like after the
header?

  The block IO device body starts with a DWORD SubType - which for ramdisk
devices is value 3. There follows the actual device body after that. For
ramdisk devices this is the following structure:

typedef struct _RAM_DISK_IDENTIFIER {
	LARGE_INTEGER ImageBase;
	ULONG64 ImageSize;
	DWORD ImageOffset;
	FILE_IDENTIFIER Source;
} RAM_DISK_IDENTIFIER, *PRAM_DISK_IDENTIFIER;

  The Source element is the only part that gets filled in by bcdedit, it's a
FILE_PATH structure, which basically consists of another boot device
structure in its entirety, followed by a UTF-16LE path string. This is the
full location to the file that gets loaded into memory by the ramdisk device
creation function.

  The ramdisk device creation function gets the file size, allocates some
memory, reads the entire file there, then places the physical address of that
memory into the ImageBase and ImageOffset elements (ImageBase gets the page-
aligned base address, and ImageOffset gets the offset into that page where that
file was read to), and ImageSize gets the size of the file.

  After this small explanation, you may wonder what happened if you just unset
bit 0 of the device flags.

  It turned out, that the boot environment would be perfectly happy with this,
and would just use whatever values were in the structure read from the BCD for
the physical address and size of the ramdisk.

  So, what can we do with this?

  When a Windows boot application opens this crafted ramdisk device, if it
reads from this device, that turns into a memcpy FROM the attacker-specified
ramdisk area. A write turns into a memcpy TO the attacker-specified ramdisk
area.

  Which means, with the right crafted ramdisk device (physical address, length
and data), a boot application could end up writing to this ramdisk which would
lead to the data being written at a wholly attacker controlled address.

  Therefore, potentially gaining code execution under a boot application, which
breaks *at least* Secure Boot, and it would also be guaranteed to allow for
BitLocker key dumping, where the osvolume is protected by BitLocker, with the
VMK sealed by TPM only, and Secure Boot used for integrity validation, which
happens to be the default settings (and the ONLY possible setting on Home
editions of Windows). If a system had automatic BitLocker enabled, again the
vulnerable configuration would be guaranteed, unless it was changed manually by
the user afterwards.

  So, what boot applications can write to a boot device, as opposed to read?

  There aren't that many places across the Windows boot environment that
actually writes to disk.

  First, there's some BCD-related code, but that's not very helpful as it will
always write the entire hive from memory back to disk.

  Second, there's a 32-bit write of a constant to a hibernation file under
winresume.efi. Which could very well be useful, one use for this could be a
data-only attack where the write is pointed very precisely to the loaded
Secure Boot Policy in bootmgr's heap, allowing for exactly one "dangerous"
boot option to be overwritten from the blocklist, which would be enough to
allow, say "nointegritychecks" which allows to load a self-signed PE as a
boot application.

  Third, there's the boot status data logging code.

  The boot status data logging code writes to an attacker-specfied path on an
attacker-specified device in the BCD.

  It is written to by at least winload and winresume, and before RS3, bootmgr
also has code to do the write after the BCD is loaded (starting from RS3,
bootmgr does it before the BCD is loaded, so will always write to the EFIESP)

  That the vulnerable code path can be reached in bootmgr, means that before
RS3, one can potentially gain code execution in bootmgr. This is important as
this would be before bootmgr extends a cap event to TPM PCR11, which means any
payload could derive then dump BitLocker keys where legacy integrity validation
is used too (where the version of bootmgr being used to boot the system is
vulnerable).

  The really interesting thing about this is that means this vulnerability can
be useful on systems without Secure Boot, or even those booting from BIOS, to
dump BitLocker keys, and even Windows Vista and 7 are affected; the issue
appears to date from Windows Vista build 5259 from November 2005, the earliest
available build that uses BCD (previous builds had bootmgr but only had support
for using boot.ini).

  After RS3, the boot status data log writes are done during boot application
initialisation for winload and winresume... before the Secure Boot policy gets
loaded. Which means any elements blocked by Secure Boot policy (which includes
the default boot status data logging device, when bitlocker with TPM is being
used) are accessible.

  So, what kind of ramdisk contents are required?

  Given that a file on disk is being written to, one needs to craft a
filesystem image, that appears to be big enough to reach past the actual size
of the file.

  The easiest, of course, would be FAT32. Even a malformed filesystem which
only allows for a single sector to be written would be enough.

  So what data gets written? Turns out it's mostly static, in bootmgr:

02 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 50 00 00 00
lo lo lo lo hi hi hi hi g0 g0 g0 g0 g1 g1 g1 g1
g2 g2 g2 g2 g3 g3 g3 g3 40 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
02 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 yy yy mm mm dd dd hh hh
mm mm ss ss ms ms wd wd 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

  The variable parts: at 0x10, 64-bit seconds count; at 0x18, a GUID which
when not exploiting bootmgr is entirely attacker controlled; at 0x38, a time
structure: 16-bit year, 16-bit month, 16-bit day, 16-bit hour, 16-bit minute,
16-bit second, 16-bit millisecond, followed by 16-bit day of week (0 to 6, or
7 if not implemented). (The time structure is TIME_FIELDS from NT.)

  In practise, the top 8 bits of most of the TIME_FIELDS elements are
guaranteed to be zero, and for the milliseconds case, guaranteed to be 0, 1, 2
or 3.

  So, what to overwrite? There's lots of interesting things in .data section of
a boot application, and that is either always loaded at a constant address (in
the case of bootmgr) or can be loaded at a known address (in other cases).

  Before RS3, the vtables for all the boot devices are stored in .data, which
means overwriting the Open() pointer for a certain device to a location where
a payload already got written to means we win.

  Since RS4, the serial port driver uses vtables located in .data, of which one
of the function pointers gets called on open.

  This means that overwriting either a serial port driver vtable, or the serial
port boot device vtable, will get code execution later on if a BCD device that
is opened later is configured to be of type serial port.

  (Which can't be specified in bcdedit of course, but is again a valid device
that can be represented in the BCD!)

  I chose to craft offsets such that the function pointer gets overwritten by
offset 0x45 on AMD64 architecture. This would lead to a physical address of
0x00000000_01000x0y, where x is between 0-7 and y is between 0-3.

  One can then ensure at every 0x100 bytes there's four nops followed by a jump
to next 0x100, and then at 0x700 a jump to the actual payload.

  How to get a payload into memory? When exploiting a second stage boot
application (winload, winresume, etc) it's easy enough, just use a properly
specified ramdisk in the boot object, of some random custom device type.
However, when exploiting bootmgr, this is more difficult as the write happens
quite early into boot. But there's one thing loaded after the BCD is parsed
but before the write happens: the .mui file.

  This is supposed to be a PE file, but starting from Windows 8 a cache is used
when a file has a size that is not sector-aligned. The entire file gets
preloaded to that cache when needed, so it doesn't even need to be a valid PE
file. But in Windows 7 and below, it has to go through the PE loader. However,
the PE file does not get wiped from memory after the signature check fails here,
so that PE loader can just be abused here as a way to load arbitrary data into
memory.

  There are several ways to ensure that everything is loaded at the "correct"
place. For example, avoidlowmemory BCD element (which is basically entirely
blocked now since baton drop also used it), or badmemorylist (which is still
fine to use, for the most part).

  The interesting thing about badmemorylist is that any consecutive ranges get
merged together, and if any of those ranges are already being used then they do
not get added to the list of physical memory pages to not use. The easiest way
around this is to use a checkerboard pattern, ie, specify every odd page or
every even page, and then have two consecutive pages at the end if needed.

  Given our allocations are definitely more than one page, this strategy works
for forcing allocations to the correct location in physical memory. When using
the PE loader under Windows 7 and below's bootmgr, one must remember that the
entire flat PE gets loaded into memory first, then the SizeOfImage gets
allocated, and PE mapped into that allocation, then the flat PE gets freed
afterwards. I personally used vmware's debugger to ensure the badmemorylist
was correct, but there are probably other methods too.

  I also ported everything to BIOS bootmgr, windows 7 and windows 8. Remember
that bootmgr under BIOS runs in x86 protected mode, even on AMD64 systems. This
is very helpful for us. Under 32-bit architectures, the FAT32 filesystem in
memory can reach the entire 32-bit physical address space.

  I will also note that offsets change slightly when targeting winload, for a
more modern version of winload, offsets are shifted slightly and the 64 bits
mentioned above is at a location of 0x49 instead of 0x45. Also, the offset of
the write inside the file is to a different offset in winload, so 0x800 byte
sectors need to be used there. 

  Note that these exploitation strategies do not mitigate modern (since ~2022)
EFI memory protection. It should be possible to work around it to ROP to
victory, but that is left as a further exercise to the reader. I did not do it
as I was testing in vmware VMs that lack memory protection in boot.

  And now I've explained how the vulnerability works and roughly how one can
exploit it, let's move on to the patching.

  The initial patch took ~4 months and was ineffective. The boot environment
knows the memory map so I suggested a fix of walking through it when opening a
ramdisk as a sane ramdisk is guaranteed to be described by a single entry in
the boot environment's memory map. The actual "fix" implemented was this: when
a device has been loaded from the BCD, check if it's a block io device of type
ramdisk, if so set flags bit 0 (require creation).

  ...Of course, we can control the entire device, so just using the crafted
ramdisk as a child device of something else, bypasses this check, and allows
for exploitation of the same vulnerability.

  When this was reported, a better fix came. Now it walks the device structure,
with code to handle all supported device types, to find specific child devices
to set the flags bit 0 on (and as a bonus the interesting structure elements
get zeroed). If more than 8 child devices were present, the function returned
error, and if a child device was unknown the function returned success.

  The first issue I discovered was that this function was backported to older
major Windows versions incorrectly and all code relating to device types
unsupported by that version of bootmgr was removed. The issue is that one could
use an older bootmgr with a device that would fail the checks in later bootmgr,
and then load a later version of winload which has code to support that device,
and continue to exploit the vulnerability. Iron introduced support for the
"composite" device type, meant to require creation, that contains two child
devices, and when opening a file, if it is not found on the first device, the
second one is used. So one could just set such a device up and have a child
device be a crafted ramdisk.

  The second was that when parsing a partition of a VHD block io device, the
incorrect offset was used when calculating the pointer to the child device,
and so instead the data used for the following "child device" was actually the
MBR signature or GPT GUID. Given that the function returns success on invalid
devices, just putting the crafted FAT image inside a VHD, which itself is
inside a FAT image, allows for the crafted ramdisk to again be used.
Technically such a fixed size VHD requires a footer rather than a header but
due to an oversight the boot environment allows a header to be used (the data
from last 0x200 bytes is used for checking the VHD type, instead of the data
from first 0x200 bytes).

  When these were fixed, there remained another exploitation method. Windows
8.1 added "wimboot" support, allowing for Windows to boot directly from a WIM
file (by use of NTFS overlays); any updated system files get written to disk.
This was implemented by use of an on-disk configuration file storing boot
device structures directly. Because the boot device structure checks were
performed during BCD load, using a wimboot overlay would not only bypass the
checks but a crafted ramdisk could be used by a vulnerable second stage boot
application without bootmgr knowing anything about it.

  Post-exploitation, one can dump BitLocker keys; if code execution was
obtained inside bootmgr, the payload can unseal BitLocker keys by TPM.

  Additionally, an evil cleaner attack could set up an EFIESP to exploit this
vulnerability and then gain code execution after the real user provides any
credentials required to unlock their boot volume protected by BitLocker.
